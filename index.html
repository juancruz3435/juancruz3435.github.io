    <h1>Introduction</h1> <!-- hgroup defines the size of the header, h1 is the largest and h6 being the smallest -->

    <p>I am a second year electrical engineering sutdent at the University of Calgary and
        this is my portfolio. I am also takinga minor in mechatronics with hopes of working 
    in the robotics field in the future. </p>

        <h2>Postcard to self</h2> <!--the <b></b> bolds the word and <i></i> italisises it -->
        <p>For my <big>postcard</big> postcard to self I was able to fulfill my main goal of finding a job. <!--the big tag makes that one word bigger-->
            Even though it is <b>not</b> engineering related it will still serve it's purpose and I will
            continue to work on engineering projects like the ones highlighted in this website and more.
