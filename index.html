            <section>
                <p style="color:blue; background-color: black;">I am a second year electrical engineering sutdent at the University of Calgary and
                this is my portfolio. I am also taking a minor in mechatronics with hopes of working 
                in the robotics field in the future. </p>

                    <h3>Postcard to self</h3> <!--the <b></b> bolds the word and <i></i> italisises it -->
                    <p>For my postcard to self I was able to fulfill my main goal of finding a job. <!--the big tag makes that one word bigger-->
                        Even though it is <b>not</b> engineering related it will still serve it's purpose and I will
                        continue to work on engineering projects like the ones highlighted in this website and more.
